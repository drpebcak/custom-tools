`List Devices` can be used to find the GUID of a device using the friendly name (called a `label` in the api).
Do not return Ids to the user unless they specifically ask for it.

Capabilities are generally whatever the current state of the device is and the opposite of that.
* For a switch, that's "on" or "off".
* For a lock, that's "lock" or "unlock".
* For devices with a 'level' capability, it is a value between 0-100.
The `Get Device Info` tool should be used to discover the current state of a Device.
